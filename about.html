            <p class = "text">Greetings! My name is <span style = "color: #f5a623"> Joshua Estangki</span>, 
a student in BSCS from <span style = "color: #f5a623"> Saint Louis University. </span> I am 18 years old, and I enjoy 
back-end development while currently exploring front-end development. <br> <br>


I am very passionate about learning different coding languages and building programs, and I love creating projects that challenges my problem-solving skills.
My goal is to be a full stack developer, and to help my peers as we go in this journey together. To do this, I use various tools such as <span style = "color: #f5a623">w3schools</span> and <span style = "color: #f5a623">java mooc-fi</span> to make learning easier.
<br> <br>

Beyond coding, I also enjoy experimenting with databases, playing video games, and improving my problem-solving skills by solving puzzles, and doing problem-solving related tasks.
I also believe that <span style = "color: #f5a623">perseverance</span> is the key in order to master the art of development.</p>
